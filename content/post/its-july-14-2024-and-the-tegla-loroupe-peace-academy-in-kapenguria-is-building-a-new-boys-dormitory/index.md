The Tegla Loroupe Peace Academy has been expanding at our beautiful site in Kapenguria.  **Please come visit.**

Our existing dormitory and kitchen is expanding, and we have started construction on a new boy's dormitory.

We now house and teach over three hundred boys and girls. Those without parents have an expanding group of resident counselors and dormitory teachers.
