TITLE OF THE PROJECT:





*Restoring Resilience: A Community-Driven
Initiative for Protection and Afforestation of Kamatira Forest in West Pokot
County.*

2.   
Implementing Organization:

Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation (TLPF)

The
Tegla Loroupe Peace Foundation (TLPF) is a respected non-profit organization
founded by world-renowned peace icon and athlete, Dr. Ambassador Tegla Loroupe.
The Foundation is known for its pioneering work in promoting peacebuilding,
environmental stewardship, education, and sustainable development among
pastoralist and conflict-prone communities in Kenya, particularly in the North
Rift region. Through its Peace and Education Centre in West Pokot, TLPF has
mobilized thousands of youths and communities to embrace peaceful coexistence
and resilience-building, including climate adaptation practices. This project
builds on TLPF’s longstanding commitment to community-led development and
climate justice.

      
3. Background and Context.

About West Pokot County:

Located
in the North Rift Valley region of Kenya, West Pokot County covers an area of
approximately 9,169.4 km². The county is home to a diverse population primarily
composed of pastoralist and agropastoral communities who rely heavily on
natural resources for their livelihoods. With more than 80% of its land
categorized as semi-arid and arid, the County faces acute challenges related to
land degradation, deforestation, food insecurity, and climate-induced disasters
such as floods, prolonged droughts, and landslides. Forests such as Kamatira,
Sondany, Solion, and Kuper are crucial to the County’s ecological balance and
biodiversity, yet they continue to suffer extensive degradation due to human
encroachment, charcoal burning, and unsustainable harvesting practices.

Kamatira Forest Profile:

Kamatira
Forest is a gazetted forest situated in Pokot South Sub-County, covering
approximately 4,507.79 hectares and a perimeter of 29.6 kilometers.
It forms part of the Cherangani Hills ecosystem and is critical for water
catchment, climate regulation, and biodiversity conservation. However, the
forest is under significant pressure from encroachment, illegal logging,
overgrazing, harvesting of medicinal plants, and a lack of enforcement and
community sensitization. The depletion of forest cover is further exacerbating
environmental degradation, poverty, and insecurity in the region. This project
seeks to reverse this trend through a comprehensive community-led forest
restoration and protection strategy that aligns with global, national, and
local development priorities.

Problem Statement.

The
degradation of Kamatira Forest threatens the ecological and socio-economic
stability of West Pokot County. Encroachment for agriculture and settlement,
overgrazing, illegal logging, and the unregulated extraction of medicinal
plants have all contributed to its rapid degradation. The absence of trained
forest personnel, limited environmental awareness, and poor infrastructure
further weaken protection efforts. 

The
consequences include increased vulnerability to climate shocks, reduced water
availability, loss of biodiversity, declining agricultural productivity, and
escalating poverty levels. Unless urgent restoration and protection efforts are
undertaken, the forest will continue to decline, compromising the county’s
resilience and development prospects.
