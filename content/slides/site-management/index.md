Main content repository is currently a public repository at https://github.com/johngage/TLPeaceFoundation.git
### Goal: move repository to location controlled by TLPF

---
 Establish how TLPF wants to:
 - manage content:
   - Site Development: add images, new text; add and edit posts; edit blog, events, staff (authors).
- Use existing github repository, Netlify site publishing, VSCode content editing
---
- Use an additional existing Content Management System: Decap CMS
- Possibly introduce Obsidian environment for content editing
- restrict editing of Github repository to TLPF developers
